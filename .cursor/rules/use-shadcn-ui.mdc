# Use shadcn/ui for UI Development

To ensure consistency, reusability, and a high-quality user interface, all new UI components, charts, and themes must be implemented using `shadcn/ui`.

## 1. Discovering Components and Features

Before implementation, use the available AI tools to discover components and research features.

### Finding Components, Charts, and Blocks
Use the **shadcn/ui MCP** to quickly find available components.

**Example Tool Call:**
```
mcp_shadcn-ui-server_search_components(query="date picker")
```
This tool can also be used to list all components, or get details and examples for a specific one. Note that "Blocks" are not a standard `shadcn/ui` concept, but you can build complex components by composing the available primitives.

### Researching Theming, Colors, and Charts
For more detailed implementation guidance on topics like theming, colors, and advanced chart configuration, use **Context7**.

**Example Tool Call:**
```
mcp_context7_get-library-docs(
  context7CompatibleLibraryID="/shadcn-ui/ui",
  topic="theming colors dark mode"
)
```

## 2. Adding and Using New Components

Once you've identified a component, add it to the project using the CLI.

### Monorepo Setup

This project uses a monorepo where `shadcn/ui` components are managed in the `@repo/ui` package, located at `packages/ui`.

### Adding a Component

1.  Navigate to the client app's directory:
    ```bash
    cd apps/client-app
    ```

2.  Run the `shadcn/ui` CLI `add` command. The CLI will automatically place the component files into the `packages/ui` directory.
    ```bash
    pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
    ```
    Replace `[component-name]` with the name from the MCP (e.g., `button`, `card`, `chart`).

### Using a Component

Import components from the `@repo/ui` package in your application's files.

**Example: Using the Button component**

```typescript
import { Button } from "@repo/ui/components/button";

function MyComponent() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```

## 3. Theming and Colors

All colors and themes are managed through `shadcn/ui`'s theming system, which relies on CSS variables.

- **Configuration:** The primary theme definition is in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`.
- **Guidance:** Use **Context7** as described in step 1 to find code snippets and documentation for creating or customizing themes and colors.
