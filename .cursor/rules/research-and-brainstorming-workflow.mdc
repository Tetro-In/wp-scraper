# Research & Brainstorming Workflow

When exploring a new topic or idea, follow this standard procedure to ensure a thorough and insightful investigation.

Important: Be very detailed with summarization and do not miss out on things that are important.

1.  **Deconstruct: "What is the core question? Let's clarify now."**
    This is the foundational phase for understanding the topic. Before diving into research, the goal is to thoroughly deconstruct the core question or topic to ensure a clear direction. This includes:

    *   Defining the core question or topic to establish a clear focus and scope.
    *   Identifying key areas of inquiry and breaking down the main topic into smaller, manageable sub-topics.
    *   Determining the initial research direction by considering different angles and perspectives to explore.
    *   Asking clarifying questions to resolve any ambiguity or to narrow down the focus of the research.

2.  **Strategize: "Here is how I will approach the research."**
    After deconstructing the topic, the next step is to develop a clear and actionable research plan. This overview will include:

    *   A summary of the core question and the intended outcome of the research.
    *   A step-by-step description of the research process. This will involve using web searches to gather general information and diverse perspectives, and consulting Context7 for specific technical documentation when applicable.
    *   An outline of the different perspectives and viewpoints that will be investigated to ensure a comprehensive understanding.
    *   The reasoning for the proposed research strategy and why it is best suited for the topic at hand.

3.  **Execute & Synthesize: "Now, I will begin the investigation."**
    Following the strategic plan, I will proceed with the research and analysis. This phase is focused on execution and delivering a comprehensive summary of the findings. This involves:

    *   Executing the research plan by gathering information from the identified sources, including web searches and Context7.
    *   Providing a detailed synthesis of the findings, highlighting key insights, main arguments, and any relevant counterarguments or conflicting data.
    *   Structuring the information in a clear and logical manner to facilitate understanding.
    *   Concluding with potential next steps or further avenues of exploration based on the research outcomes.
