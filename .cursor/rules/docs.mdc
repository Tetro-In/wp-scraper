# Documentation Sourcing Policy

This document outlines the required sources for retrieving documentation for various libraries and frameworks.

## 1. C-RAG for Curated Libraries

For the libraries listed below, you **MUST** use the `c-rag` MCP tools to ensure you are working with the most up-to-date and project-specific information.

### C-RAG Library List:
- **Turborepo**
- **Better Auth**

### C-RAG Workflow:
1.  Call `mcp_c-rag_get_available_sources()`
2.  Use `mcp_c-rag_perform_rag_query()` for specific questions.
3.  Use `mcp_c-rag_search_code_examples()` for code patterns.

## 2. Context7 & Web Search for All Other Documentation

For **any library not listed above**, you **MUST** use the following tools in order of preference:

1.  **`context7` tools**: The primary choice for any library documentation.
2.  **`web_search`**: For general queries or if `context7` is not applicable.

## Rationale
This policy ensures you use up-to-date documentation, preventing bugs from outdated knowledge. The C-RAG system is specially curated for core project libraries, while `context7` and `web_search` provide broader coverage for everything else.
