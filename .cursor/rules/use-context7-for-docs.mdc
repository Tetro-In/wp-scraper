# Context7 Documentation Rule

This rule outlines how to use the Context7 MCP (Model-Copilot-Protocol) to retrieve up-to-date documentation for any library, framework, or module.

## Purpose

To ensure the AI assistant has access to the latest documentation, preventing issues caused by outdated knowledge from its training data. This is particularly useful when working with rapidly evolving technologies.

## Procedure

When you need information about a specific library or module (e.g., its API, usage patterns, configuration), follow these steps:

### 1. Resolve the Library ID

First, you must obtain the Context7-compatible library ID.

- **Action**: Call the `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` tool.
- **Parameter `libraryName`**: Use the common name of the library (e.g., "turborepo", "prisma", "better-auth", "remix").

**Example Tool Call:**
```
mcp_context7_resolve-library-id(libraryName="better-auth")
```

The tool will return a list of matching libraries. Select the most relevant one based on the name, description, and trust score.

### 2. Fetch the Documentation

Once you have the exact library ID, you can fetch its documentation.

- **Action**: Call the `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` tool.
- **Parameter `context7CompatibleLibraryID`**: Use the ID obtained from the previous step (e.g., `/better-auth/better-auth`).
- **Parameter `topic` (optional)**: Specify a topic to narrow down the search (e.g., "hooks", "API routes", "middleware").

**Example Tool Call:**
```
mcp_context7_get-library-docs(
  context7CompatibleLibraryID="/better-auth/better-auth",
  topic="next.js handlers API routes"
)
```

### 3. Utilize the Documentation

The tool will return relevant documentation snippets. Use this information to:
- Answer the user's questions accurately.
- Implement code changes according to the latest best practices.
- Provide examples from the documentation.
