# Feature Development Workflow

When implementing a new feature, follow this standard procedure to ensure clarity, correctness, and alignment with project goals.

**Important**: Be very detailed with summarization and do not miss out on things that are important.

### 1. Understand: "What is the goal? Let's clarify now."

This is the requirements-gathering and research phase. Before writing any code, I will use all available tools to thoroughly understand the feature's purpose and technical requirements. This includes:
-   **Analyzing user requirements** to define the scope and acceptance criteria.
-   **Searching the codebase** to identify existing components, services, or routes that can be leveraged or will be impacted.
-   **Consulting documentation** (e.g., `shadcn/ui`, Remix, Prisma) using **Context7** or web search to determine the best implementation strategy and identify necessary components.
-   **Asking clarifying questions** if the requirements are ambiguous or incomplete.

### 2. Plan: "Here is how I will build it."

After the research phase, I will synthesize my findings into a clear, actionable implementation plan. This overview will include:
-   A **summary of the feature** and its intended functionality.
-   A **step-by-step description** of the implementation, detailing which files will be created or modified.
-   An outline of any **new components, API endpoints, or database schema changes**.
-   The **reasoning** for the proposed technical approach.

### 3. Implement & Verify: "Do not generate any code until I tell you to proceed!"

**Important**: This is a hard stop. I will not execute the plan or make any changes to the codebase until you give explicit approval (e.g., "proceed," "yes," "continue"). This ensures you have full control over all modifications.

Once you approve, I will:
-   **Execute the plan** by writing code and making the specified changes.
-   **Provide a summary** of the implementation.
-   **Outline clear steps** for you to manually test and verify that the feature works as expected.
